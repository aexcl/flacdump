FLAC & WAV File Sharing Platform

Project Overview

This project is a lightweight platform for exchanging lossless audio files (FLAC and WAV) among a small group of trusted users. It was created to address the limitations of conventional cloud services, such as copyright issues and access rights, while also serving as a practical learning exercise during my retraining as an application developer.

Purpose

Pragmatic Purpose: Enable friends to share self-produced, lossless audio files without relying on physical hard drive exchanges or running into issues with conventional cloud services.

Learning Purpose: Strengthen and apply the skills and concepts learned during my vocational training as a software developer.
